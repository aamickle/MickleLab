The lab has recently received a notice of award for a new 5-year R01 to study the role of urothelial cells in sensory signaling. With Co-investigators Jim Hokanson and Shahab Vadat (UC -Riverside), we will start to define a role for the sensory component of urothelial cells in bladder sensation, interoception, and pain.  This study will use a recently published animal model that allows us to isolate urothelial stimulation using optogenetics.  Congrats to the whole team!
