Dr. Mickle was recently on the  College of Veterinary Medicine Voice Podcast, talking about the lab's research into new approaches for understanding and treating bladder pain syndrome. Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) affects millions of Americans, and current treatment options are ineffective for many patients. In this podcast, Aaron Mickle Ph.D tells us about his project that aims to determine the role of angiotensin signaling in developing and maintaining disease symptoms of IC/BPS using animal models. These results could open up new FDA- approved treatments with widely available and safe angiotensin inhibitors, substantially impacting patients’ quality of life.
