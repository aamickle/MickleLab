New paper alert. A collaborative project with Yi Zhang's group at UConn developing novel coatings for soft and flexible implantable devices. [Liquid-based encapsulation for implantable bioelectronics across broad pH environments](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-55992-x). Congrats to Gabbie from our lab as the co-first Author.
