A new publication that was truly a team effort! Co-first authors Gabbie Robilotto, Firoj Alom, and Olivia Yang demonstrate in a [AJP-renal publication](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajprenal.00035.2023) that urothelial cells communicate with sensory neurons. 
New and Noteworthy: 
Urothelial cells play a sensory role in bladder function. However, it has been particularly challenging to study this communication as both sensory neurons and urothelial cells express similar sensory receptors. Here, we demonstrate, using an optogenetic technique, that specific urothelial stimulation alone resulted in bladder contractions. This approach will have a long-lasting impact on how we study urothelial-to-sensory neuron communication and the changes that occur under disease conditions.
