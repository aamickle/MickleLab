Congrats to Drs. Firoj Alom and Sabhya Rana on their co-first author publication in [eLife](https://elifesciences.org/articles/89767)! We show evidence that AMPA receptors play a key role in bladder function. Additionally, we show convincingly that AMPA allosteric activators can ameliorate many of the subacute defects in bladder and external urethral sphincter function following SCI, including prolonged voiding intervals and high bladder pressure thresholds for voiding. These valuable results in rodents may help in the development of these agents as therapeutics for humans with SCI-induced bladder dysfunction.
