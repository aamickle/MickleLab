Our dynamic team at the Medical College of Wisconsin is seeking a post-doctoral researcher to join our group studying mechanisms of bladder sensation, interoception, and pain. The candidate would have the opportunity to lead studies involving signaling between nociceptors and non-neuronal cells in models of interstitial cystitis and bladder pain. They would have the opportunity to learn a variety of techniques from animal behavior, cytometric testing, electrophysiology, fMRI, and optogenetics. Additionally, there are resources available to initiate independent projects with the aim of building an independent research career. Interested applicants can reach out to Aaron Mickle directly through email amickle@mcw.edu. More information about the lab can be found at micklelab.com
