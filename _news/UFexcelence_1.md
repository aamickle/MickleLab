Dr. Mickle, an assistant professor in the department of Physiological Sciences at the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine, has been awarded the 2023 University of Florida Excellence Award for Assistant Professors, a campus-wide achievement and top honor for junior faculty.




Dr. Mickle's main research focuses on studying the nervous system's contribution to bladder dysfunction and pain. There are two primary arms to his research program. The first is to study the role of bladder endothelial cells in bladder sensation and pain related to bladder diseases such as interstitial cystitis and overactive bladder. The second focuses on the development of therapeutics (pharmaceutical and implantable devices) as treatments for bladder dysfunction following spinal cord injury.




Dr. Mickle has published 30 papers, including work in highly-ranked journals, including Nature, Neuron, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and Scientific Advances.  He has been invited to present at multiple institutions and international conferences. Since arriving to UF, Dr. Mickle has received a NIH R21, a NIH R01, and Rita Allen Foundation Award.




In addition to a successful lab, Dr. Mickle has initiated a mentoring workshop for the College of Veterinary Medicine. Through this effort, he will continue to impact and build up existing and future trainees for the college and university at large.
