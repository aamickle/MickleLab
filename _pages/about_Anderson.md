I am pursuing a PhD in Biomedical Engineering with a specialization in neural engineering. My research is focused on the role of angiotensin type II receptor as it relates to bladder function and pain. I graduated from the University of Memphis in the spring of 2023 with bachelors in biomedical engineering and mathematical sciences. I have research background in tissue engineering and cognitive neuroscience. 

In my free time, I enjoy being active, watching movies, and spending time with friends and family.
