I have a diverse research background that includes: behavioral neuroscience, molecular and cellular neuroscience, neuropharmacology, neurophysiology, urology, and biomedical engineering. My current research focuses on incorporating molecular, cellular, and whole-animal approaches to answer questions in relation to bladder physiology and pain relief mechanisms. I have an extensive interest in continuing to advance the field of bladder physiology research, visceral pain mechanisms, education, and training. 

In my free time, I chase around my three kids and enjoy camping, backpacking, and 3D printing/design.
