I have obtained DVM and MS in Pharmacology degrees from Bangladesh. I was awarded PhD in veterinary sciences from Japan in 2019 where I studied signal transduction pathways leading to contraction/relaxation of smooth muscles in the intestine and urinary bladder targeting to find out a molecular target for the specific treatment of overactive bladder condition. I have an academic background and teaching experience in the field of physiology and pharmacology. 

I pass my leisure time by playing with my three kids, fishing, watching cricket on TV and going outside with my family for sightseeing.
