  abstract =   "Local renin-angiotensin signaling is present within various organ systems of the body. Angiotensin II signaling acts as a crucial mechanism of the renin-angiotensin signaling system. In this manuscript, we review current literature regarding local angiotensin II signaling in the urinary bladder. Our interest in this pathway is due to its potential role in interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome and other bladder diseases, which are chronic in nature and negatively affect patients' quality of life. Current treatments for bladder diseases are generally ineffective due to our lack of understanding of their pathophysiology. We evaluate literature investigating angiotensin II signaling in the bladder across several perspectives, including local expression and production, functional properties, tissue morphology, and clinical implications. Further, we identify gaps in knowledge and suggest areas where we can improve our understanding of angiotensin II signaling in the bladder.",journal={American Journal of Physiology-Renal Physiology},

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome (UCPPS), which
              includes interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) and
              chronic prostatitis (CP/CPPS), is associated with increased
              voiding frequency, nocturia, and chronic pelvic pain. The cause
              of these diseases is unknown and likely involves many different
              mechanisms. Dysregulated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system
              (RAAS) signaling is a potential pathologic mechanism for IC/BPS
              and CP/CPPS. Many angiotensin receptor downstream signaling
              factors, including oxidative stress, fibrosis, mast cell
              recruitment, and increased inflammatory mediators, are present in
              the bladders of IC/BPS patients and prostates of CP/CPPS
              patients. Therefore, we aimed to test the hypothesis that UCPPS
              patients have dysregulated angiotensin signaling, resulting in
              increased hypertension compared to controls. Secondly, we
              evaluated symptom severity in patients with and without
              hypertension and antihypertensive medication use. METHODS: Data
              from UCPPS patients (n = 424), fibromyalgia or irritable bowel
              syndrome (positive controls, n = 200), and healthy controls (n =
              415) were obtained from the NIDDK Multidisciplinary Approach to
              the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain I (MAPP-I). Diagnosis of
              hypertension, current antihypertensive medications, pain
              severity, and urinary symptom severity were analyzed using
              chi-square test and t-test. RESULTS: The combination of diagnosis
              and antihypertensive medications use was highest in the UCPPS
              group (n = 74, 18\%), followed by positive (n = 34, 17\%) and
              healthy controls (n = 48, 12\%, p = 0.04). There were no
              differences in symptom severity based on hypertension in UCPPS
              and CP/CPPS; however, IC/BPS had worse ICSI (p = 0.031), AUA-SI
              (p = 0.04), and BPI pain severity (0.02). Patients (n = 7) with a
              hypertension diagnosis not on antihypertensive medications
              reported the greatest severity of pain and urinary symptoms.
              CONCLUSION: This pattern of findings suggests that there may be a
              relationship between hypertension and UCPPS. Treating
              hypertension among these patients may result in reduced pain and
              symptom severity. Further investigation on the relationship
              between hypertension, antihypertensive medication use, and UCPPS
              and the role of angiotensin signaling in UCPPS conditions is

  abstract = "Neurogenic bladder dysfunction causes urological complications and reduces the quality of life in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). Glutamatergic signaling via AMPA receptors is fundamentally important to the neural circuits controlling bladder voiding. Ampakines are positive allosteric modulators of AMPA receptors that can enhance the function of glutamatergic neural circuits after SCI. We hypothesized that ampakines can acutely stimulate bladder voiding that has been impaired due to thoracic contusion SCI. Adult female Sprague–Dawley rats received a unilateral contusion of the T9 spinal cord (n = 10). Bladder function (cystometry) and coordination with the external urethral sphincter (EUS) were assessed 5 d post-SCI under urethane anesthesia. Data were compared to responses in spinal-intact rats (n = 8). The ‘low-impact’ ampakine CX1739 (5, 10, or 15 mg/kg) or vehicle (2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin [HPCD]) was administered intravenously. The HPCD vehicle had no discernible impact on voiding. In contrast, following CX1739, the pressure threshold for inducing bladder contraction, voided volume, and the interval between bladder contractions were significantly reduced. These responses occurred in a dose-dependent manner. We conclude that modulating AMPA receptor function using ampakines can rapidly improve bladder-voiding capability at subacute time points following contusion SCI. These results may provide a new and translatable method for therapeutic targeting of bladder dysfunction acutely after SCI."

  abstract = "Urothelial cells, which play an essential role in barrier
              function, are also thought to play a sensory role in bladder
              physiology by releasing signaling molecules in response to
              sensory stimuli that act upon adjacent sensory neurons. However,
              it is challenging to study this communication due to the overlap
              in receptor expression and proximity of urothelial cells to
              sensory neurons. To overcome this challenge, we developed a mouse
              model where we can directly stimulate urothelial cells using
              optogenetics. We crossed a uroplakin II (UPK2) cre mouse with a
              mouse that expresses the light-activated cation channel
              channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in the presence of cre expression.
              Optogenetic stimulation of urothelial cells cultured from
              UPK2-ChR2 mice initiates cellular depolarization and release of
              ATP. Cystometry recordings demonstrated that optical stimulation
              of urothelial cells increases bladder pressure and pelvic nerve
              activity. Increases in bladder pressure persisted, albeit to a
              lesser extent, when the bladder was excised in an in vitro
              preparation. The P2X receptor antagonist PPADS significantly
              reduced optically evoked bladder contractions in vivo and ex
              vivo. Furthermore, corresponding nerve activity was also
              inhibited with PPADS. Our data suggest that urothelial cells can
              initiate robust bladder contractions via sensory nerve signaling
              or contractions through local signaling mechanisms. These data
              support a foundation of literature demonstrating communication
              between sensory neurons and urothelial cells. Importantly, with
              further use of these optogenetic tools, we hope to scrutinize
              this signaling mechanism, its importance for normal micturition
              and nociception, and how it may be altered in pathophysiological
              conditions.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Urothelial cells play a sensory role
              in bladder function. However, it has been particularly
              challenging to study this communication as both sensory neurons
              and urothelial cells express similar sensory receptors. Here we
              demonstrate using an optogenetic technique, that specific
              urothelial stimulation alone resulted in bladder contractions.
              This approach will have a long-lasting impact on how we study
              urothelial-to-sensory neuron communication and the changes that
              occur under disease conditions.",

               different populations of neurons. However, efficient targeting

               Andrew J and Mickle, Aaron D",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1),
               activated by heat, acidic pH, endogenous vanilloids and
               capsaicin, is essential for thermal hyperalgesia. Under
               inflammatory conditions, phosphorylation of TRPV1 by protein
               kinase C (PKC) can sensitize the channel and decrease the
               activation threshold. Src kinase also phosphorylates TRPV1,
               promoting channel trafficking to the plasma membrane. These
               post-translational modifications are important for several
               chronic pain conditions. This study presents a previously
               undescribed relationship between Src and PKC phosphorylation of
               TRPV1, influencing the thermal hypersensitivity associated with
               TRPV1 activation. METHODS: We assessed TRPV1 channel activity
               using intracellular calcium imaging and patch-clamp
               electrophysiology in mouse dorsal root ganglion cultures.
               Additionally, we used behavioural experiments to evaluate
               plantar thermal sensitivity following intraplantar injections of
               activators of known modulators of TRPV1 with and without an Src
               antagonist. RESULTS: Using calcium imaging and patch-clamp
               techniques, we demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of
               Src kinase or mutation of the Src phosphorylation site on TRPV1
               prevented PKC but not PKA-mediated sensitization of TRPV1 in
               vitro. We found that intraplantar injection of the PKC activator
               phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or bradykinin produces
               thermal hypersensitivity that can be attenuated by
               pharmacological inhibition of Src. Additionally, complete
               Freund's Adjuvant (CFA)-induced inflammatory hypersensitivity
               could also be attenuated by local Src kinase inhibition.
               CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that Src phosphorylation is
               critical for PKC-mediated sensitization of TRPV1. Further, in a
               model of inflammatory pain, CFA, Src kinase inhibition could
               reduce thermal hypersensitivity. Targeting of Src kinase may
               have analgesic benefits in inflammatory pain conditions.
               SIGNIFICANCE: Src kinase-mediated phosphorylation of TRPV1 is a
               critical regulator of the PKC-induced sensitization induced by
               multiple inflammatory mediators. This suggest a new regulatory
               mechanism governing TRPV1 function and a potential therapeutic
               target for inflammatory type pain, including cancer pain where
               Src antagonists are currently utilized.",

               stimulation of hollow organs, including the colon and bladder,
               is controlled distensions mediated by compressed air. For
               example, distension of the bladder can be used as an assay for
               bladder nociception. Bladder distension causes a corresponding
               increase in abdominal electromyography, which increases with
               distension pressure and is attenuated with analgesics. However,
               the hardware used to control these distensions are primarily all

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVES: Abdominal electromyogram or visceromotor response
               (VMR) elicited by bladder distension is a validated as a measure
               of bladder nociception in mice, however it is not without its
               limitations. The aim of this study is to address some of these
               limitations and validate voiding evoked VMR as a measure of
               bladder nociception mice. METHODS: Using both male and female
               C57BL/6 mice we assessed the VMR response to cytometry- induced
               voiding before and after instillation of 0.5\% acetic acid into
               the bladder. We then delivered intravesical lidocaine to confirm
               the VMR response as nociceptive. VMR and correlative cystometric
               bladder pressures were analyzed. RESULTS: We found that the VMR
               can be evoked by continuous fluid infusion into the bladder of
               both male and female mice. This response is potentiated after
               bladder injury and can be attenuated by administration of a
               local anesthetic, providing strong evidence that this method can
               be used to evaluate bladder nociception. Further, evaluation of
               cystometric pressure traces obtained during VMR recording
               revealed that intercontraction intervals were not altered after
               bladder injury in either male or female mice. However, we did
               observe a decrease in peak threshold pressures after bladder
               injury in female mice, which could be rescued by lidocaine
               administration. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this technique can
               measure the VMR and bladder nociception associated with voiding
               in both female and male mice. Although confounds still exist

               technology relies largely on electrical stimulation to provide
               neuromodulation of organ function or pain. One example is sacral
               nerve stimulation to treat overactive bladder, urinary
               incontinence and interstitial cystitis (also known as bladder
               pain syndrome)4,6,7. Conventional, continuous stimulation
               protocols, however, can cause discomfort and pain, particularly
               when treating symptoms that can be intermittent (for example,
               sudden urinary urgency)8. Direct physical coupling of electrodes
               to the nerve can lead to injury and inflammation9-11.
               Furthermore, typical therapeutic stimulators target large nerve
               bundles that innervate multiple structures, resulting in a lack
               of organ specificity. Here we introduce a miniaturized
               bio-optoelectronic implant that avoids these limitations by
               using (1) an optical stimulation interface that exploits
               microscale inorganic light-emitting diodes to activate opsins;
               (2) a soft, high-precision biophysical sensor system that allows

               module and data analytics approach that enables coordinated,
               closed-loop operation of the system to eliminate pathological

               treatment of postherpetic neuralgia suggests angiotensin

               transcriptome analysis indicates a lack of AT2R gene (Agtr2)

               questions regarding the tissue/cell target underlying the

              cellular and molecular processes that culminate in
              hyperexcitation of sensory nerves, which underlies chronic
              inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Using behavioral readouts of
              pain hypersensitivity induced by angiotensin II (Ang II)
              injection into mouse hindpaws, our study shows that activation of
              the type 2 Ang II receptor (AT2R) and the cell-damage-sensing ion
              channel TRPA1 are required for peripheral mechanical pain
              sensitization induced by Ang II in male and female mice. However,
              we show that AT2R is not expressed in mouse and human dorsal root
              ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons. Instead, expression/activation of
              AT2R on peripheral/skin macrophages (M$\Phi$s) constitutes a
              critical trigger of mouse and human DRG sensory neuron
              excitation. Ang II-induced peripheral mechanical pain
              hypersensitivity can be attenuated by chemogenetic depletion of
              peripheral M$\Phi$s. Furthermore, AT2R activation in M$\Phi$s
              triggers production of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, which
              trans-activate TRPA1 on mouse and human DRG sensory neurons via
              cysteine modification of the channel. Our study thus identifies a
              translatable immune cell-to-sensory neuron signaling crosstalk
              underlying peripheral nociceptor sensitization. This form of
              cell-to-cell signaling represents a critical peripheral mechanism
              for chronic pain and thus identifies multiple druggable analgesic
              targets.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Pain is a widespread health
              problem that is undermanaged by currently available analgesics.
              Findings from a recent clinical trial on a type II angiotensin II
              receptor (AT2R) antagonist showed effective analgesia for
              neuropathic pain. AT2R antagonists have been shown to reduce
              neuropathy-, inflammation- and bone cancer-associated pain in
              rodents. We report that activation of AT2R in macrophages
              (M$\Phi$s) that infiltrate the site of injury, but not in sensory
              neurons, triggers an intercellular redox communication with
              sensory neurons via activation of the cell damage/pain-sensing
              ion channel TRPA1. This M$\Phi$-to-sensory neuron crosstalk
              results in peripheral pain sensitization. Our findings provide an
              evidence-based mechanism underlying the analgesic action of AT2R
              antagonists, which could accelerate the development of

  abstract = "Bone metastasis in breast, prostate and lung cancers often leads
              to chronic pain, which is poorly managed by existing analgesics.
              The neurobiological mechanisms that underlie chronic pain
              associated with bone-metastasized cancers are not well
              understood, but sensitization of peripheral nociceptors by tumor
              microenvironment factors has been demonstrated to be important.
              Parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) is highly expressed
              in bone-metastasized breast and prostate cancers, and is critical
              to growth and proliferation of these tumors in the bone tumor
              microenvironment. Previous studies have suggested that PTHrP
              could sensitize nociceptive sensory neurons, resulting in
              peripheral pain hypersensitivity. In this study, we found that
              PTHrP induces both heat and mechanical hypersensitivity, that are
              dependent on the pain-transducing transient receptor potential
              channel family vanilloid, member-1 (TRPV1), but not the
              mechano-transducing TRPV4 and TRPA1 ion channels. Functional
              ratiometric Ca2+ imaging and voltage-clamp electrophysiological
              analysis of cultured mouse DRG neurons show significant
              potentiation of TRPV1, but not TRPA1 or TRPV4 channel activation
              by PTHrP. Interestingly, PTHrP exposure led to the slow and
              sustained activation of TRPV1, in the absence of any exogenous
              channel agonist, and is dependent on the expression of the type-1
              parathyroid hormone receptor (PTH1), as well as on downstream
              phosphorylation of the channel by protein kinase C (PKC).
              Accordingly, local administration of specific small-molecule
              antagonists of TRPV1 to mouse hindpaws after the development of
              PTHrP-induced mechanical hypersensitivity led to its significant
              attenuation. Collectively, our findings suggest that
              PTHrP/PTH1-mediated flow activation of TRPV1 channel contributes
              at least in part to the development and maintenance of peripheral
              mechanical pain hypersensitivity, and could therefore constitute
              a mechanism for nociceptor sensitization in the context of

              inhibition of nociceptive sensory afferents could be used to
              modulate bladder pain. The light-activated inhibitory proton pump
              Archaerhodopsin (Arch) was expressed under control of the sensory

              untethered animals, wireless powering and device durability pose
              challenges in studies of spinal cord circuits where dynamic,
              multidimensional motions against hard and soft surrounding

              fully implantable optoelectronic device powered by near-field
              wireless communication technology, with a thin and flexible open
              architecture that provides excellent mechanical durability,
              robust sealing against biofluid penetration and fidelity in
              wireless activation, thereby allowing for long-term optical
              stimulation of the spinal cord without constraint on the natural
              behaviors of the animals. The system consists of a double-layer,
              rectangular-shaped magnetic coil antenna connected to a
              microscale inorganic light-emitting diode ($\mu$-ILED) on a thin,

              the critical detectors and transducers of pain-causing stimuli.
              Nociceptive TRP channels are predominantly expressed by distinct
              subsets of sensory neurons of the peripheral nervous system.
              Several of these TRP channels are also expressed in neurons of
              the central nervous system, and in non-neuronal cells that
              communicate with sensory nerves. Nociceptive TRPs are activated
              by specific physico-chemical stimuli to provide the excitatory
              trigger in neurons. In addition, decades of research has
              identified a large number of immune and neuromodulators as
              mediators of nociceptive TRP channel activation during injury,
              inflammatory and other pathological conditions. These findings

               found at elevated levels in the tumor microenvironment of
               advanced breast and prostate cancers, is a critical modulator of
               sensory neurons. Intraplantar injection of PTHrP led to the
               development of thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity in both
               male and female mice, which were absent in mice lacking
               functional transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1). The
               PTHrP treatment of cultured mouse sensory neurons enhanced
               action potential firing, and increased TRPV1 activation, which
               was dependent on protein kinase C (PKC) activity. Parathyroid
               hormone-related peptide induced robust potentiation of TRPV1

               pathological activation of sensory neurons through upregulation
               of TRPV1 function and trafficking, which could serve as a

               acid (TNBS). The effect of TEG on the VMR was tested by
               injecting intraperitoneal (i.p.), intrathecal (i.t.),
               intracerebroventricular (i.c.v) or in the rostroventral medulla
               (RVM). The effect of the drug was also tested on responses of
               CRD-sensitive pelvic nerve afferents (PNA) and lumbo-sacral (LS)
               spinal neurons. Systemic injection of TEG attenuated VMR in
               naive and TNBS-treated rats. Similarly, supraspinal, but not
               spinal, injection of TEG attenuated the VMR. While GR113808,
               (selective 5-HT(4) antagonist) blocked the effect, naloxone
               (NLX) an opioid receptor antagonist reversed the effect of TEG.
               Although i.t. NLX did not block the inhibitory effect of TEG in
               VMR study, i.t. injection of $\alpha$2-adrenergic receptor
               antagonist yohimbine blocked the effect of TEG when given
               systemically. While TEG had no effect on the responses of
               CRD-sensitive PNA, it inhibited the responses of CRD-sensitive
               LS neurons in spinal intact condition. This inhibition was
               blocked by GR113808, NLX and $\beta$-funaltrexamine
               ($\beta$-FNA) when injected into the RVM. Results indicate that
               TEG produces analgesia via activation of supraspinal 5-HT(4)
               receptors which triggers the release of opioids at supraspinal
               site, which activates descending noradrenergic pathways to the
               spinal cord to produce analgesia.",

  abstract  = "The chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1$\alpha$
               (SDF-1$\alpha$) has multiple effects on neuronal activity,
               survival, and death under conditions that generate a
               proinflammatory microenvironment within the brain, via signaling
               through C-X-C-type chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), although the
               underlying cellular/molecular mechanisms are unclear. Using rat
               hippocampal neurons, we investigated distinct modifications in
               the voltage-gated K⁺ (Kv) channel Kv2.1 in response to short-
               and long-term SDF-1$\alpha$/CXCR4-mediated signaling as an
               underlying mechanism for CXCR4-dependent regulation of neuronal
               survival and death. Acute exposure of neurons to SDF-1$\alpha$
               led to dynamic dephosphorylation and altered localization of
               Kv2.1 channel, resulting in enhanced voltage-dependent
               activation of Kv2.1-based delayed-rectifier Kv currents (I(DR)).
               These changes were dependent on CXCR4- and/or NMDA
               receptor-mediated activation of calcineurin and provide
               neuroprotection. However, prolonged SDF-1$\alpha$ treatment
               leads to CXCR4-mediated activation of p38 mitogen-activated
               protein kinase, resulting in phosphorylation of Kv2.1 at S800
               and enhanced surface trafficking of the channel protein,
               resulting in increased I(DR)/Kv2.1 current density. This, in
               combination with sustained dephosphorylation-induced enhancement
               of the voltage-dependent activation of I(DR)/Kv2.1, predisposed
               neurons to excessive K⁺ efflux, a vital step for the neuronal
               apoptotic program. Such apoptotic death was dependent on CXCR4
               and Kv2.1 function and was absent in cells expressing the
               Kv2.1-S800A mutant channel. Furthermore, similar modifications
               in Kv2.1 and CXCR4/Kv2.1-dependent apoptosis were observed
               following treatment of neurons with the human immunodeficiency
               virus-1 (HIV-1) glycoprotein gp120. Therefore, distinct
               modifications in Kv2.1 in response to short- and long-term
               CXCR4-mediated signaling could provide a basis for
               neuroprotection or apoptosis in neuropathologies, such as

               modulation of visceral pain is controversial. The objective of
               this study was to systematically examine the mechanism and site
               of action of a selective 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist
               8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin (DPAT) on visceral pain.
               In the behavioral model of visceral pain, systemic injection
               (5-250 $\mu$g/kg) of DPAT produced a significant increase in the
               viscero-motor response (VMR) to colorectal distension (CRD) and
               this effect was blocked by the selective 5-HT(1A) receptor
               antagonist WAY-100135 (5 mg/kg, s.c.). Similarly, intrathecal
               (i.t.) injection (5 $\mu$mol) of DPAT into the lumbo-sacral
               (L6-S1) spinal cord produced a significant increase in VMR. The
               administration of N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
               antagonist AP5 (50 $\mu$g/kg) prior to DPAT injection completely
               blocked the pronociceptive effect of DPAT. Similarly, DPAT
               failed to increase VMR in rats chronically treated with NR1
               subunit-targeted antisense oligonucleotide (ON), whereas the
               drug increased VMR in rats treated with mismatched-ON. Chronic
               i.t. injection of allylglycine (AG), a $\gamma$-amino
               decarboxylase (GAD) enzyme inhibitor, produced significant
               increase in VMRs, suggesting that the inhibition of GABA
               synthesis produces pronociception. In AG-treated rats, i.t.
               injection of DPAT failed to further increase in VMR, suggesting
               that the DPAT action is linked to GABA release. Similarly,
               WAY-100135 failed to attenuate VMR in AG-treated rats,
               suggesting that unlike DPAT, AG action is not via the activation
               of 5-HT(1A) receptors. In electrophysiology experiments, DPAT
               (50 $\mu$g/kg) significantly increased the responses of spinal
               neurons to CRD, but did not influence the mechanotransduction
               property of CRD-sensitive pelvic nerve afferent fibers. The
               effect of DPAT on spinal neurons remained unaffected when tested
               in spinal-transected (C1-C2) rats. These results indicate that
               the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist DPAT produces pronociceptive
               effects, primarily via the activation of presynaptic 5-HT(1A)
               receptors in GABAergic neuron to restrict GABA release and
               thereby disinhibits the excitatory glutamatergic neurons in the

               the underlying mechanisms remain essentially unknown. Many
               biological effects of NPs are mediated by guanylate cyclase
               (GC)-coupled NP receptors, NPR-A and NPR-B, whereas the third NP
               receptor, NPR-C, lacks the GC kinase domain and acts as the NP

               neurons and increased their firing frequency, an effect that was
               absent in DRG neurons from TRPV1(-/-) mice. CNP-induced
               sensitization of TRPV1 activity was attenuated by pretreatment

               phospholipase C-$\beta$ (PLC$\beta$), or PKC, but not of protein
               kinase A, and was abolished by mutations at two PKC
               phosphorylation sites in TRPV1. Furthermore, CNP injection into
               mouse hindpaw led to the development of thermal hyperalgesia
               that was attenuated by administration of specific inhibitors of
               G$\beta$$\gamma$ or TRPV1 and was also absent in TRPV1(-/-)

               neonatal cystitis alters colonic sensitivity later in life and
               to investigate the role of peripheral mechanisms. METHODS:
               Neonatal rats received intravesical zymosan, normal saline, or
               anesthesia only for three consecutive days [(postnatal (PN) days
               14-16)]. The estrous cycle phase was determined prior to
               recording the visceromotor response (VMR) to colorectal
               distension (CRD) in adult rats. Eosinophils and mast cells were
               examined from colon and bladder tissues. CRD- or urinary bladder
               distension (UBD)-sensitive pelvic nerve afferents (PNAs) were
               identified and their responses to distension were examined. The
               relative expression of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA)-NR1
               subunit in the lumbo-sacral (L6-S1) spinal cord was examined
               using Western blot. KEY RESULTS: The VMR to CRD ($\geq$10mmHg)
               in the neonatal zymosan group was significantly higher than
               control in both the diestrus, estrus phase and in all phases
               combined. There was no difference in the total number of
               eosinophils, mast cells or number of degranulated mast cells
               between groups. The spontaneous firing of UBD, but not
               CRD-sensitive PNAs from the zymosan-treated rats was
               significantly higher than the saline-treated control. However,
               the mechanosensitive properties of PNAs to CRD or UBD were no
               different between groups (P>0.05). The expression of spinal NR1
               subunit was significantly higher in zymosan-treated rats
               compared with saline-treated rats (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS \&
               INFERENCES: Neonatal cystitis results in colonic
               hypersensitivity in adult rats without changing tissue histology
               or the mechanosensitive properties of CRD-sensitive PNAs.

               Extracellular single-unit recordings were made from
               CRD-sensitive pelvic nerve afferent (PNA) fibers and lumbosacral

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Several types of gastric surgeries have
               been associated with early satiety, dyspepsia and food
               intolerances. We aimed to examine alterations in gastric vagal
               afferents following gastric surgery-fundus ligation. METHODS:
               Six week old, male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent chronic
               ligation (CL) of the fundus. Sham rats underwent abdominal
               surgery, but without ligation. Another group of rats underwent
               acute ligation (AL) of the fundus immediately prior to
               experiments. CL and sham rats were allowed to grow to age 3-4
               months. Food intake and weights were recorded post-operatively.
               Gastric compliance and gastric wall thickness was measured at
               baseline and during gastric distension (GD). Extracellular
               recordings were made to examine response characteristics of
               vagal afferent fibers to GD and to map the stomach receptive
               field (RF). The morphological structures of afferent terminals
               in the stomach were examined with retrograde tracings from the
               nodose ganglion. RESULTS: The CL group consumed significantly
               less food and weighed less than sham control. The mean
               compliance of the CL group was significantly less than control,
               but higher than the AL group. The spontaneous firing and
               responses to GD of afferent fibers from the CL rats were
               significantly higher than AL rats. There was a marked expansion
               of the gastric RF in the CL rats with significant reorganization
               and regeneration of intramuscular array (IMA) terminals. There
               was no difference in total wall or muscle thickness among the
               groups. CONCLUSION: CL results in aberrant remodeling of IMAs
               with expansion of the gastric RF and alters the
               mechanotransduction properties of vagal afferent fibers. These
               changes could contribute to altered sensitivity following
               gastric surgery.",

  Abstract={Emerging classes of bioresorbable electronic materials serve as the basis for active biomedical implants that are capable of providing sensing, monitoring, stimulating, and other forms of function over an operating period matched to biological processes such as wound healing. These platforms are of interest because subsequent dissolution, enzymatic degradation, and/or bioresorption can eliminate the need for surgical extraction. This report introduces natural wax materials as long-lived, hydrophobic encapsulation layers for such systems, where biodegradation eventually occurs by chain scission. Studies of wax stability as an encapsulation material demonstrate the ability to retain operation of underlying biodegradable electronic systems for durations between a few days to a few weeks during complete immersion in aqueous solutions in ex-vivo physiological conditions. Electrically conductive composites result from the addition of tungsten micro/nanoparticles, as a conductive, printable paste with similar lifetimes. Demonstrations of these materials in partially biodegradable wireless light-emitting diodes and near-field communication circuits illustrate their use in functional bioresorbable electronic systems. Investigations in animal models reveal no signs of toxicity or other adverse biological responses.},
