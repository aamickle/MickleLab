   Abstract={Neurogenic bladder dysfunction causes urological complications and reduces the quality of life in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). Glutamatergic signaling via AMPA receptors is fundamentally important to the neural circuits controlling bladder voiding. Ampakines are positive allosteric modulators of AMPA receptors that can enhance the function of glutamatergic neural circuits after SCI. We hypothesized that ampakines can acutely stimulate bladder voiding that has been impaired due to thoracic contusion SCI. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats received a unilateral contusion of the T9 spinal cord (n = 10). Bladder function (cystometry) and coordination with the external urethral sphincter (EUS) were assessed 5 d post-SCI under urethane anesthesia. Data were compared to responses in spinal-intact rats (n = 8). The 'low-impact' ampakine CX1739 (5, 10, or 15 mg/kg) or vehicle (2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin [HPCD]) was administered intravenously. The HPCD vehicle had no discernible impact on voiding. In contrast, following CX1739, the pressure threshold for inducing bladder contraction, voided volume, and the interval between bladder contractions were significantly reduced. These responses occurred in a dose-dependent manner. We conclude that modulating AMPA receptor function using ampakines can rapidly improve bladder-voiding capability at subacute time points following contusion SCI. These results may provide a new and translatable method for therapeutic targeting of bladder dysfunction acutely after SCI.},

   Abstract={Urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome (UCPPS), which includes interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) and chronic prostatitis (CP/CPPS), is associated with increased voiding frequency, nocturia, and chronic pelvic pain. The cause of these diseases is unknown and likely involves many different mechanisms. Dysregulated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) signaling is a potential pathologic mechanism for IC/BPS and CP/CPPS. Many angiotensin receptor downstream signaling factors, including oxidative stress, fibrosis, mast cell recruitment, and increased inflammatory mediators, are present in the bladders of IC/BPS patients and prostates of CP/CPPS patients. Therefore, we aimed to test the hypothesis that UCPPS patients have dysregulated angiotensin signaling, resulting in increased hypertension compared to controls. Secondly, we evaluated symptom severity in patients with and without hypertension and antihypertensive medication use.\\ 415) were obtained from the NIDDK Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain I (MAPP-I). Diagnosis of hypertension, current antihypertensive medications, pain severity, and urinary symptom severity were analyzed using chi-square test and t-test.\\ 7) with a hypertension diagnosis not on antihypertensive medications reported the greatest severity of pain and urinary symptoms.\\ This pattern of findings suggests that there may be a relationship between hypertension and UCPPS. Treating hypertension among these patients may result in reduced pain and symptom severity. Further investigation on the relationship between hypertension, antihypertensive medication use, and UCPPS and the role of angiotensin signaling in UCPPS conditions is needed.}

No significant difference between the serotypes in the transduction of sensory neurons was noted, and all serotypes were more efficient in transducing NF200 + neurons compared to smaller CGRP + neurons. AAV-retro was more efficient at transducing motor neurons compared to other serotypes. Moreover, PHP.S was more efficient at transducing sympathetic neurons, and AAV-retro was more efficient at transducing parasympathetic neurons. These results indicate that specific AAV serotypes target peripheral neuron populations more efficiently than others in the neonatal rat.}

   Abstract={Transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1), activated by heat, acidic pH, endogenous vanilloids and capsaicin, is essential for thermal hyperalgesia. Under inflammatory conditions, phosphorylation of TRPV1 by protein kinase C (PKC) can sensitize the channel and decrease the activation threshold. Src kinase also phosphorylates TRPV1, promoting channel trafficking to the plasma membrane. These post-translational modifications are important for several chronic pain conditions. This study presents a previously undescribed relationship between Src and PKC phosphorylation of TRPV1, influencing the thermal hypersensitivity associated with TRPV1 activation.\\ We assessed TRPV1 channel activity using intracellular calcium imaging and patch-clamp electrophysiology in mouse dorsal root ganglion cultures. Additionally, we used behavioural experiments to evaluate plantar thermal sensitivity following intraplantar injections of activators of known modulators of TRPV1 with and without an Src antagonist.\\ Using calcium imaging and patch-clamp techniques, we demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of Src kinase or mutation of the Src phosphorylation site on TRPV1 prevented PKC but not PKA-mediated sensitization of TRPV1 in vitro. We found that intraplantar injection of the PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or bradykinin produces thermal hypersensitivity that can be attenuated by pharmacological inhibition of Src. Additionally, complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA)-induced inflammatory hypersensitivity could also be attenuated by local Src kinase inhibition.\\ Our data demonstrate that Src phosphorylation is critical for PKC-mediated sensitization of TRPV1. Further, in a model of inflammatory pain, CFA, Src kinase inhibition could reduce thermal hypersensitivity. Targeting of Src kinase may have analgesic benefits in inflammatory pain conditions.\\ Src kinase-mediated phosphorylation of TRPV1 is a critical regulator of the PKC-induced sensitization induced by multiple inflammatory mediators. This suggest a new regulatory mechanism governing TRPV1 function and a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory type pain, including cancer pain where Src antagonists are currently utilized.}

   Month="Apr",
   Abstract={Studying the visceral sensory component of peripheral nervous systems can be challenging due to limited options for consistent and controlled stimulation. One method for mechanical stimulation of hollow organs, including the colon and bladder, is controlled distensions mediated by compressed air. For example, distension of the bladder can be used as an assay for bladder nociception. Bladder distension causes a corresponding increase in abdominal electromyography, which increases with distension pressure and is attenuated with analgesics. However, the hardware used to control these distensions are primarily all one-off custom builds, without clear directions on how to build your own. This has made it difficult for these methods to be fully utilized and replicated as not everyone has the access, knowledge, and resources required to build this controller. Here we show an open-source Arduino-based system for controlling a solenoid valve to deliver timed pressure distensions in the experimental model. This device can be controlled by one of two methods through direct TTL pulses from the experimenter's data acquisition software (ex. CED Spike2) or by a graphical user interface, where the user can set the time before, during, and after distension as well as the number of cycles. This system's low cost and relative ease to build will allow more groups to utilize timed pressure distensions in their experiments.}

   Abstract={Abdominal electromyogram or visceromotor response (VMR) elicited by bladder distension is a validated as a measure of bladder nociception in mice, however it is not without its limitations. The aim of this study is to address some of these limitations and validate voiding evoked VMR as a measure of bladder nociception mice.\\ Using both male and female C57BL/6 mice we assessed the VMR response to cytometry- induced voiding before and after instillation of 0.5% acetic acid into the bladder. We then delivered intravesical lidocaine to confirm the VMR response as nociceptive. VMR and correlative cystometric bladder pressures were analyzed.\\ We found that the VMR can be evoked by continuous fluid infusion into the bladder of both male and female mice. This response is potentiated after bladder injury and can be attenuated by administration of a local anesthetic, providing strong evidence that this method can be used to evaluate bladder nociception. Further, evaluation of cystometric pressure traces obtained during VMR recording revealed that intercontraction intervals were not altered after bladder injury in either male or female mice. However, we did observe a decrease in peak threshold pressures after bladder injury in female mice, which could be rescued by lidocaine administration.\\ In conclusion, this technique can measure the VMR and bladder nociception associated with voiding in both female and male mice. Although confounds still exist with the use of anesthesia, further exploration of non-anesthetized voiding-evoked VMR is warranted.}

Traditional hardware for these purposes can cause notable damage to fragile nerve tissues, create irritation at the biotic/abiotic interface, and alter the natural behaviors of animals. Here, we present a wireless, battery-free device that integrates a microscale inorganic light-emitting diode and an ultralow-power microfluidic system with an electrochemical pumping mechanism in a soft platform that can be mounted onto target peripheral nerves for programmed delivery of light and/or pharmacological agents in freely moving animals. Biocompliant designs lead to minimal effects on overall nerve health and function, even with chronic use in vivo. The small size and light weight construction allow for deployment as fully implantable devices in mice. These features create opportunities for studies of the peripheral nervous system outside of the scope of those possible with existing technologies.}

Here we introduce a miniaturized bio-optoelectronic implant that avoids these limitations by using (1) an optical stimulation interface that exploits microscale inorganic light-emitting diodes to activate opsins; (2) a soft, high-precision biophysical sensor system that allows continuous measurements of organ function; and (3) a control module and data analytics approach that enables coordinated, closed-loop operation of the system to eliminate pathological behaviours as they occur in real-time. In the example reported here, a soft strain gauge yields real-time information on bladder function in a rat model. Data algorithms identify pathological behaviour, and automated, closed-loop optogenetic neuromodulation of bladder sensory afferents normalizes bladder function. This all-optical scheme for neuromodulation offers chronic stability and the potential to stimulate specific cell types.}

   Abstract={Parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) is associated with advanced tumor growth and metastasis, especially in breast, prostate and myeloma cancers that metastasize to bones, resulting in debilitating chronic pain conditions. Our recent studies revealed that the receptor for PTHrP, PTH1R, is expressed in mouse DRG sensory neurons, and its activation leads to flow-activation and modulation of TRPV1 channel function, resulting in peripheral heat and mechanical hypersensitivity. In order to verify the translatability of our findings in rodents to humans, we explored whether this signalling axis operates in primary human DRG sensory neurons. Analysis of gene expression data from recently reported RNA deep sequencing experiments performed on mouse and human DRGs reveals that PTH1R is expressed in DRG and tibial nerve. Furthermore, exposure of cultured human DRG neurons to PTHrP leads to slow-sustained activation of TRPV1 and modulation of capsaicin-induced channel activation. Both activation and modulation of TRPV1 by PTHrP were dependent on PKC activity. Our findings suggest that functional PTHrP/PTH1R-TRPV1 signalling exists in human DRG neurons, which could contribute to local nociceptor excitation in the vicinity of metastatic bone tumor microenvironment.}

   Abstract={imaging and voltage-clamp electrophysiological analysis of cultured mouse DRG neurons show significant potentiation of TRPV1, but not TRPA1 or TRPV4 channel activation by PTHrP. Interestingly, PTHrP exposure led to the slow and sustained activation of TRPV1, in the absence of any exogenous channel agonist, and is dependent on the expression of the type-1 parathyroid hormone receptor (PTH1), as well as on downstream phosphorylation of the channel by protein kinase C (PKC). Accordingly, local administration of specific small-molecule antagonists of TRPV1 to mouse hindpaws after the development of PTHrP-induced mechanical hypersensitivity led to its significant attenuation. Collectively, our findings suggest that PTHrP/PTH1-mediated flow activation of TRPV1 channel contributes at least in part to the development and maintenance of peripheral mechanical pain hypersensitivity, and could therefore constitute a mechanism for nociceptor sensitization in the context of metastatic bone cancer pain.}

   Abstract={Specialized receptors belonging to the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ligand-gated ion channels constitute the critical detectors and transducers of pain-causing stimuli. Nociceptive TRP channels are predominantly expressed by distinct subsets of sensory neurons of the peripheral nervous system. Several of these TRP channels are also expressed in neurons of the central nervous system, and in non-neuronal cells that communicate with sensory nerves. Nociceptive TRPs are activated by specific physico-chemical stimuli to provide the excitatory trigger in neurons. In addition, decades of research has identified a large number of immune and neuromodulators as mediators of nociceptive TRP channel activation during injury, inflammatory and other pathological conditions. These findings have led to aggressive targeting of TRP channels for the development of new-generation analgesics. This review summarizes the complex activation and/or modulation of nociceptive TRP channels under pathophysiological conditions, and how these changes underlie acute and chronic pain conditions. Furthermore, development of small-molecule antagonists for several TRP channels as analgesics, and the positive and negative outcomes of these drugs in clinical trials are discussed. Understanding the diverse functional and modulatory properties of nociceptive TRP channels is critical to function-based drug targeting for the development of evidence-based and efficacious new generation analgesics.}

   Abstract={The neurobiological mechanisms underlying chronic pain associated with cancers are not well understood. It has been hypothesized that factors specifically elevated in the tumor microenvironment sensitize adjacent nociceptive afferents. We show that parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), which is found at elevated levels in the tumor microenvironment of advanced breast and prostate cancers, is a critical modulator of sensory neurons. Intraplantar injection of PTHrP led to the development of thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity in both male and female mice, which were absent in mice lacking functional transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1). The PTHrP treatment of cultured mouse sensory neurons enhanced action potential firing, and increased TRPV1 activation, which was dependent on protein kinase C (PKC) activity. Parathyroid hormone-related peptide induced robust potentiation of TRPV1 activation and enhancement of neuronal firing at mild acidic pH that is relevant to acidic tumor microenvironment. We also observed an increase in plasma membrane TRPV1 protein levels after exposure to PTHrP, leading to upregulation in the proportion of TRPV1-responsive neurons, which was dependent on the activity of PKC and Src kinases. Furthermore, co-injection of PKC or Src inhibitors attenuated PTHrP-induced thermal but not mechanical hypersensitivity. Altogether, our results suggest that PTHrP and mild acidic conditions could induce constitutive pathological activation of sensory neurons through upregulation of TRPV1 function and trafficking, which could serve as a mechanism for peripheral sensitization of nociceptive afferents in the tumor microenvironment.}

   Pages="73--118",
   Abstract={Peripheral detection of nociceptive and painful stimuli by sensory neurons involves a complex repertoire of molecular detectors and/or transducers on distinct subsets of nerve fibers. The majority of such molecular detectors/transducers belong to the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of cation channels, which comprise both specific receptors for distinct nociceptive stimuli, as well as for multiple stimuli. This chapter discusses the classification, distribution, and functional properties of individual TRP channel types that have been implicated in various nociceptive and/or painful conditions.}

   Abstract={efflux, a vital step for the neuronal apoptotic program. Such apoptotic death was dependent on CXCR4 and Kv2.1 function and was absent in cells expressing the Kv2.1-S800A mutant channel. Furthermore, similar modifications in Kv2.1 and CXCR4/Kv2.1-dependent apoptosis were observed following treatment of neurons with the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) glycoprotein gp120. Therefore, distinct modifications in Kv2.1 in response to short- and long-term CXCR4-mediated signaling could provide a basis for neuroprotection or apoptosis in neuropathologies, such as neuroinflammation, stroke, brain tumors, and HIV-associated neurodegeneration.}

   Abstract={g/kg) significantly increased the responses of spinal neurons to CRD, but did not influence the mechanotransduction property of CRD-sensitive pelvic nerve afferent fibers. The effect of DPAT on spinal neurons remained unaffected when tested in spinal-transected (C1-C2) rats. These results indicate that the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist DPAT produces pronociceptive effects, primarily via the activation of presynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors in GABAergic neuron to restrict GABA release and thereby disinhibits the excitatory glutamatergic neurons in the spinal cord.},

   Abstract={The objective of this study was to determine if neonatal cystitis alters colonic sensitivity later in life and to investigate the role of peripheral mechanisms.\\ Neonatal rats received intravesical zymosan, normal saline, or anesthesia only for three consecutive days [(postnatal (PN) days 14-16)]. The estrous cycle phase was determined prior to recording the visceromotor response (VMR) to colorectal distension (CRD) in adult rats. Eosinophils and mast cells were examined from colon and bladder tissues. CRD- or urinary bladder distension (UBD)-sensitive pelvic nerve afferents (PNAs) were identified and their responses to distension were examined. The relative expression of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA)-NR1 subunit in the lumbo-sacral (L6-S1) spinal cord was examined using Western blot.\\ 0.05).\\ Neonatal cystitis results in colonic hypersensitivity in adult rats without changing tissue histology or the mechanosensitive properties of CRD-sensitive PNAs. Neonatal cystitis does result in overexpression of spinal NR1 subunit in adult rats.},

Both luzindole and naltrexone blocked melatonin's effect on the VMR and LS spinal neurons. Results indicate melatonin's antinociceptive effects are not via a peripheral site of action but rather a supra-spinal process linked to the central opioidergic system.},

   Abstract={Several types of gastric surgeries have been associated with early satiety, dyspepsia and food intolerances. We aimed to examine alterations in gastric vagal afferents following gastric surgery-fundus ligation.\\ Six week old, male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent chronic ligation (CL) of the fundus. Sham rats underwent abdominal surgery, but without ligation. Another group of rats underwent acute ligation (AL) of the fundus immediately prior to experiments. CL and sham rats were allowed to grow to age 3-4 months. Food intake and weights were recorded post-operatively. Gastric compliance and gastric wall thickness was measured at baseline and during gastric distension (GD). Extracellular recordings were made to examine response characteristics of vagal afferent fibers to GD and to map the stomach receptive field (RF). The morphological structures of afferent terminals in the stomach were examined with retrograde tracings from the nodose ganglion.\\ The CL group consumed significantly less food and weighed less than sham control. The mean compliance of the CL group was significantly less than control, but higher than the AL group. The spontaneous firing and responses to GD of afferent fibers from the CL rats were significantly higher than AL rats. There was a marked expansion of the gastric RF in the CL rats with significant reorganization and regeneration of intramuscular array (IMA) terminals. There was no difference in total wall or muscle thickness among the groups.\\ CL results in aberrant remodeling of IMAs with expansion of the gastric RF and alters the mechanotransduction properties of vagal afferent fibers. These changes could contribute to altered sensitivity following gastric surgery.},
