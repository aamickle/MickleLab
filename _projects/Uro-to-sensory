Urothelial cells play an active role in bladder physiology by responding to physical/chemical stimuli and signaling to sensory neurons and other cell types in the bladder. Numerous bladder diseases affecting millions of people, including overactive bladder, pain related to recurrent bladder infection, chemotherapeutic cystitis, and bladder pain syndrome, have been suspected to disrupt urothelial sensory signaling, leading to pathological changes to sensory signaling, including pain. While it has been accepted that urothelial cells play a role in bladder sensory function, it is unclear how these cells contribute to the sensation of filling and how it is altered under painful conditions. To unravel the role of urothelial cells in bladder nociception and sensory dysfunction, we have developed a novel mouse model that allows for direct stimulation of urothelial cells using optogenetics, light activated proteins. This project broadly focuses on functionally and molecularly identify the population of sensory neurons responding to direct urothelial stimulation of sensory nerve activity in normal and inflammatory conditions.  We are using in vivo electrophysiology, fMRI and wireless implantable LEDs paired with behavior to study this question.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
